"""worker.py

This file defines Celery tasks for the backend application. Celery is a distributed
task queue that allows for asynchronous execution of long-running or resource-intensive
tasks, preventing them from blocking the main FastAPI application thread.

Purpose:
- To offload background tasks from the main web server process.
- To enable scalable and reliable execution of tasks like heatmap generation,
  data processing, or other computational jobs.
- To ensure the FastAPI application remains responsive to user requests.

Key Features:
- Celery application configuration, specifying the message broker and result backend.
- Definition of asynchronous tasks using the `@celery_app.task` decorator.
- Example task for generating heatmaps, simulating a machine learning inference process.

def generate_heatmap_task(report_id: str):
    """Asynchronously generates a heatmap for a given medical report.

    This Celery task is triggered to offload the computationally intensive process
    of generating an XAI (Explainable AI) heatmap from the main application thread.
    It simulates a long-running operation, such as model inference and heatmap generation.

    In a real-world scenario, this task would:
    1. Fetch the report details and the associated medical image from the database.
    2. Load a trained machine learning model (e.g., a deep learning model for image analysis).
    3. Use an XAI technique (e.g., Grad-CAM, LIME) to generate a heatmap for the image,
       highlighting regions of interest for the model's prediction.
    4. Save the generated heatmap to a persistent file storage (e.g., S3, local disk).
    5. Update the report's status and store the path to the heatmap in the database.

    Args:
        report_id (str): The unique identifier for the report for which to generate the heatmap.
                         This ID is used to retrieve relevant data and associate the result.

    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary containing the status of the task and the path to the generated heatmap.
              This result can be retrieved by the FastAPI application using the task ID.

    """
    print(f"Heatmap generation started for {report_id}.")

    # In a real application, this task would involve:
    # 1.  **Fetching Data:** Retrieve the medical image and relevant report details from the database
    #     using the `report_id`. This might involve fetching the image file from secure storage.
    #     Example: `report = crud.report.get(db, id=report_id)`
    #              `image_path = report.medical_image.file_path`
    #
    # 2.  **Loading Model:** Load the appropriate trained machine learning model (e.g., a PyTorch or TensorFlow model)
    #     that was used to generate the original analysis report. This model would typically be loaded
    #     from a persistent storage (e.g., a model registry or a file system).
    #     Example: `model = load_model(report.model_version)`
    #
    # 3.  **Applying XAI Technique:** Use an Explainable AI library (e.g., Captum for PyTorch, TF-Explain for TensorFlow)
    #     to generate a heatmap. Common techniques include Grad-CAM, LIME, SHAP, etc.
    #     Example: `heatmap = generate_grad_cam(model, image_data, target_class)`
    #
    # 4.  **Saving Heatmap:** Save the generated heatmap image to a persistent, secure file storage.
    #     This could be a local directory, cloud storage (S3, Azure Blob Storage), or a dedicated image server.
    #     Example: `heatmap_output_path = f"/path/to/secure_storage/heatmaps/heatmap_{report_id}.png"`
    #              `save_image(heatmap, heatmap_output_path)`
    #
    # 5.  **Updating Database:** Update the `AnalysisReport` record in the database with the path to the
    #     generated heatmap and potentially update the report status to indicate completion.
    #     Example: `crud.report.update(db, db_obj=report, obj_in={"heatmap_path": heatmap_output_path, "status": "COMPLETED"})`

    # Simulate a time-consuming operation (e.g., AI model inference, complex image processing).
    import time

    time.sleep(
        10
    )  # Simulates a 10-second process to demonstrate asynchronous execution.

    print(f"Heatmap generation completed for {report_id}.")
    # Return a dictionary with the status and the path to the generated heatmap.
    # This dictionary will be stored in the Celery backend and can be retrieved by the caller.
    return {"status": "completed", "path": f"/tmp/heatmap_{report_id}.png"}
