# This file specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore within the backend directory.
# It helps to keep the repository clean by excluding files that are generated or contain sensitive information.

# Ignore local environment variable files.
# `.env` files often contain sensitive information like database credentials or API keys
# and should not be committed to version control.
