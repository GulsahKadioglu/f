"""secure_aggregator.py

This file provides utility functions and a conceptual Flower strategy for
handling homomorphically encrypted model parameters. It includes functions for
serializing and deserializing TenSEAL encrypted vectors to and from Flower's
`Parameters` format.

Purpose:
- To provide the necessary serialization and deserialization mechanisms for
  transporting encrypted model weights between Flower clients and the server.
- To define a placeholder `SecureAggregator` strategy that illustrates where
  homomorphic aggregation logic would be implemented in a real-world scenario.

Key Components:
- `encrypted_vectors_to_parameters`: Serializes TenSEAL vectors for client-to-server transport.
- `parameters_to_encrypted_vectors`: Deserializes received data back into TenSEAL
  vectors on the server.
- `SecureAggregator`: A conceptual Flower strategy demonstrating the structure
  for secure aggregation.
