"""self_supervised_pretrain.py

This file provides a placeholder script for self-supervised pre-training of a
vision model (e.g., a Vision Transformer) on unlabeled medical images. The goal
of self-supervised learning is to learn meaningful representations from the data
itself, without requiring explicit labels. These learned representations can then
be fine-tuned on a smaller, labeled dataset for a specific downstream task.

Purpose:
- To leverage large amounts of unlabeled medical data to learn robust features.
- To improve the performance and data efficiency of the final supervised model.
- To provide a template for implementing a self-supervised learning pipeline.

Key Components:
- `UnlabeledMedicalDataset`: A PyTorch Dataset class for loading unlabeled images.
- `SimCLRHead`: A simple projection head, often used in contrastive learning methods
  like SimCLR, to project the learned features into a different space for the
  contrastive loss calculation.
- `self_supervised_pretrain`: The main function that orchestrates the pre-training
  process, including model setup, data loading, training loop, and saving the
  pre-trained backbone model.
