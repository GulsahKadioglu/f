// This file is used by Jest to set up the testing environment before running tests.
// It's typically configured in `jest.config.js` under `setupFilesAfterEnv`.

// Imports `@testing-library/jest-dom` which provides custom Jest matchers for asserting on DOM nodes.
// This allows for more readable and semantic assertions in tests (e.g., `expect(element).toBeInTheDocument()`).
