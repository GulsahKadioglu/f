# .env.example
#
# This file serves as an example for the environment variables required by the
# `mobile-app`. It outlines the necessary configuration parameters that should
# be set in a `.env` file (which is typically not committed to version control)
# for the mobile application to function correctly.
#
# Purpose:
# - To provide a template for developers to set up their local development environments.
# - To list all essential environment variables that the mobile application expects.
# - To ensure sensitive or environment-specific configurations are kept out of source control.
#
# Usage:
# 1. Copy this file to `.env` in the same directory: `cp .env.example .env`
# 2. Replace the placeholder values with your actual configuration.
# 3. Ensure the `.env` file is listed in `.gitignore` to prevent accidental commits.
#
# Key Variables:
# - `API_URL`: The base URL of the backend API server that the mobile application
#              will communicate with. This is crucial for all API requests.
