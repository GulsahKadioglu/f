# .gitignore
#
# This file specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore
# when managing the `mobile-app` repository. Ignoring certain files helps
# keep the repository clean, prevents sensitive information from being committed,
# and avoids including large, generated, or temporary files that are not
# essential for version control.
#
# Purpose:
# - To prevent sensitive data (like API keys, credentials) from being committed.
# - To exclude build artifacts, temporary files, and local development configurations.
# - To ensure that only relevant source code and configuration files are tracked by Git.
#
# Each line in this file represents a pattern for files or directories to ignore.
#
# Ignored Patterns:
# - `.env`: Environment variable files, which often contain sensitive API keys
#           or local configuration that should not be shared or committed.
.env
# - `node_modules/`: The directory where npm (Node Package Manager) installs
#                    all project dependencies. These files are typically very large
#                    and can be regenerated from `package.json` and `package-lock.json`.
